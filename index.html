      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The year is 1889 and the wild west as it is known in the dime novels and new-fangled moving pictures is dying. Gone are the days of stagecoaches venturing west to claim land they feel destined to inhabit. Now, the land good for settling is all settled. Mechanical inventions such as the locomotive and moving picture seek to pervert the rough and tumble life many have become accustomed to out west, bringing a wicked, possibly lethal dose of safety and prosperity. The cowboy is a dying breed clinging to life in the wake of such progress, but this does little to temper the flames they hide within their hearts. 
        <br><br>
        However, within recent times, a new adversary has made itself known. Much prejudice is now shown upon the west of Texas, particularly the cities and counties surrounding Odessa. The famous Odessa crater, once a mere tourist attraction, is said to be having a strange effect on the townsfolk. Doors lock tight. Windows are shuttered. Some do not even acknowledge them, and yet they prowl regardless, these wicked beasts of the night.</p>

      <h2>Odessa</h2>
      <p>Odessa is an impermanent place. As a watering hole on the trailhead, the average passerby within the fifty square miles or so will tell you they’re just passing through. Friends are made, lost, and forgotten here. However, these truths are ingrained within the Odessa citizens who learn young to blow with the wind. Odessa is a melting pot, a microcosm of the American experiment with permanent residents and travelers alike from all corners of the globe due to the innovation of the railroad. Odessa was one of the first cities in Texas to gain and embrace a railroad, one which connected to a blossoming international rail network.
      <br><br>
      There are plenty of things to do for travelers in Odessa. The various saloons throughout town offer plenty of stories and good drinks. The shops are stocked with odds and ends from all over the world with exotic delights available to any with dollars… or bullets. It is routine for the wealthy from Baltimore and New York to enlist cowboys to take them on tours of the landscape. The lucky would be taken a day's travel south to the breathtaking views of Mount Livermore. The less lucky would return largely unharmed, though a great few dollars poorer, not by choice. There is the replica of Stonehenge, assembled and disassembled seemingly at random. And, of course, there is the great crater. 
      <br><br>
      It's rumored that a man from the census wants it to be one of the new seven wonders. But permanent residents think it is anything but wonderful. The crater glows at night. Even the snobs in Dallas know that. But it also whispers. Too often, sleep will be interrupted by the cool breeze of the desert night. The sleeping will awake to find themselves lit only by the moon, their unconscious bodies beckoned to the crater’s edge. And it will begin to whisper terrible truths.

       <h2>San Angelo</h2>
       <p>
          San Angelo, formerly Santa Angela, all came into existence rather quickly. A farmer would break their neck spinning it around to see the once trade post of their father’s youth in its modern state. What was once a crossroads blossomed in a lawless strip of rare green in the Texas deserts. Gambling, whorehouses, saloons, guns, cowboys, vaqueros - the law is nowhere to be seen here. 
         <br><br>
         Even for career criminals, San Angelo is nowhere to take lightly. The honor among thieves so often portrayed in the dime novels is nowhere to be seen, with robberies and gunfights being one in the same, most times. “A hip without a gun”, as the old saying goes, “is a naked one.” 
         <br><br>
         The blood and humid air are thick in San Angelo. Family ties run deep as the roots of the green into the soil. A river runs through the town with a bed of thick blood beneath it. The natural splendor here is more than many other towns, with many trees and small bodies of water throughout. But older than the trees are family ties. Though no alliances between any last here, a rare exception is made for the criminal dynasties which rule San Angelo.

      <h2>Fort Griffin and The Flat</h2>
      <p>
        The story of Fort Griffin and The Flat is a tale of two cities. As Fort Griffin was established, a small community began to grow around it as soldiers brought their wives and children out to the new frontier. This city, which stood upon a hill overlooking a large flat clearing of woods, was known as a disciplined town of God-fearing men and women who lived regular, safe lives. Or, at least they did until those first few settlements began springing up down in The Flat.
        <br><br>
        Gambling. Prostitutes. Whiskey. Moonshine. Cigarettes. Cigars. Grass. Opium. Morphine. Handguns. Shotguns. Rifles. Hell, even dynamite. If you want it and know you shouldn’t, it's bought and sold in the flat like canned fruit and bread. All matters of goods and services available to any with some dollars.
        <br><br>
        The Colonel who runs Fort Griffin has attempted to keep a hold on The Flat since its inception, but with so many of his soldiers being enforcers by day and customers by night, wiping out the filth seems nigh impossible. Still, it's a coin flip whether or not a soldier will bring a stripper down to the jailhouse or to his motel room away from prying eyes.
