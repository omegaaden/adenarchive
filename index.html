      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Storytelling, in the modern age, is inaccessible to most individuals. Traditional storytelling is the root of my passion, writing. But in the age of hyperconsumerism, when a film’s importance is measured by runtime and a painting’s grandeur is a matter of inches, writing as the direct descendent of storytelling has become a silent, monotone practice in patience. Books are monoliths with stories measured in hundreds of pages, impersonal tales written only for the widest possible appeal. The death of the author is a symptom of the widening separation between the story and the storyteller. The archive is here to, hopefully, begin healing that festering wound. Each story has an accompanying audio recording of me, the author, reading it as well as commentary about my intentions and a reflection on the writing process. The writer and the reader share a planet, we are not species separated by star systems. With a greater understanding of who I am and my background, the reading experience is enhanced and supremely personal. Within this archive are all of the stories I have written. All of them. Unedited, unfiltered, no tune-ups, no rewrites.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>My name is Robert Lonergan, but you can call me by my middle name, Aden. I was born and raised in Texas where I attended school and was applauded for my writing ability. Chasing the admiration of peers which I severely lacked due to intolerance towards my LGBTQ+ identity, I continued to write, entering and placing in UIL’s Ready Writing competition on the state level. By high school, I found myself writing articles for my local newspaper and even having a personal essay of mine published by an independent journal in my town. Already published, I pursued a minor in creative writing through the University of Texas at Dallas. I found there that I had a knack for the unnerving and uncomfortable, niches naturally lending themselves to the horrific and surreal. My writing style has been described as tense and overpowering with a few of my peers noting that they needed a break after reading some of my pieces. This is more true for my later works, as my earlier works were somewhat pretentious imitations of the grandeur inherent to literary classics. Some great inspirations of mine are the works of Zdzisław Beksiński, the writings of Franz Kafka, and the films of Michael Haneke.</p>

      <h2>Afterparty</h2>
      <p>“Dude, McCarthy’s gonna’ kill me!” Graham blurted out in a panic in James’ direction. “Bro, relax. It’s gonna’ be ok. It’s not even a hard prompt.” “How am I supposed to write four paragraphs about a time I relied on a friend? God dude, I can’t fail another year of English like this!” “It’ll be ok man, I swear. I mean, you really need to have freshman English to go to college.” “Dude, shut up! I can’t think! What’s an alliteration again?” Graham puzzled. He sat on the leather couch, rocking ever-so-slightly from the vibrations that emanated from the DJ booth. Even the stolen prom banner strewn across the ceiling fan seemed to annoy him in a taunting manner. Red and green lights flashed throughout the room, and he felt, though he was surrounded by people, that he was completely alone. The carefree dancers around him seemed to move their hips in just the right way to communicate how stupid he was leaving this essay for the last minute. Outside, he could hear a car pull up, even from all the way up on the hill where the Mackay Manor sat. He hoped the bolt cutters were still leaning against the opening in the chain link fence that surrounded the property since he had to return it to his dad’s shed. “Man,” James called out, breaking Graham’s introspection, “I can’t afford to see you all down. Let’s go to the snack table.” Graham, even over the blaring pop music, could still hear James. He looked up, sighed, and lifted himself from the folds of the couch, almost begging him to stay. “So you arranged this whole party?” asked Graham. “Yeah,” replied James, “I know Mackay Manor is sort of an urban legend, but all of the other venues would cost money. Plus, who’ll be coming by this place? Plus, there’s plenty of bedrooms…” He gave Graham wide eyes and a quick jab with his elbow. They walked to the snack table across the foyer and saw plenty of familiar faces. Graham saw Whitman, president of, Chess Club, Student Council, Book Club, Art Club, heck, probably Club Club, proving his dominance by shredding on Guitar Hero. Then there was Jordan, studying his phone with headphones in. Graham liked Jordan; he had clean handwriting, and it was very easy for him to see what he was writing on his Chemistry tests. DeMarcus was in the kitchen, making something disgusting out of the ingredients from the snack table, and was likely to dare people to eat it. Katie and Sadie stood at the mantle in behind the DJ’s booth. The mantle housed an empty plaque, a mounted hunting gun, and plenty of red Solo cups filled with still somewhat-bubbly soda. The deer head that used to be on the plaque was broken during a stupid party game someone made up that caught on. Graham glanced at Katie and Sadie, whom both blushed before turning away and giggling. There was a sudden knock on the door. James glanced through the peephole and opened the door. Graham watched as the man outside, who seemed to be wearing some kind of robes, said something to James sharply. James brushed off the comment, gave the man a one-hundred dollar bill, and was given a brown bag and three large boxes in return. James spun around to the now wide-eyed guests. “Booze is here!” James opened the bag to reveal some cheap alcohol; no-name whiskey, Everclear, and some Fireball. The cases were Bud-Lite, three twelve-packs. The cases were swiftly torn into by the crowd. Sadie came up to the table visibly nervous, with Katie grinning ear-to-ear at the mantle. Graham turned and she was already breaking the seal on the whiskey. “That’s some pretty strong stuff there, little lady.” twanged Graham in an awful southern accent he swore he knew. “Well I can hold my alcohol, partner.” chimed back Sadie. “You guys crushed it at the game last night. Our volleyball team rocks this year!” said Graham, struggling in a shouting contest with the music. “Hey girls,” interjected James, “Y’all lookin’ to have some fun tonight?” Unannounced to her, Katie was now at Sadie’s side. “I’ve already got a glass. Hey, tell your friend he needs to be careful, mine had a hole in the top.” said Katie, holding up her can. Her attention shifted from James to Sadie. “Sadie, don’t you want to ask Graham something?” “Uhm..” she stumbled back, “No, I don’t think so.” “Well Graham,” Katie started. “Ok fine, fine.” Sadie looked up at Graham. “Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to maybe go to one of the games together sometime?” She asked, slowly getting quieter. “She’s asking you out, Graham!” said James, punching his arm. Graham rubbed his arm. “Yeah, that’d be great.” Sadie smiled and motioned for Graham to follow her. She went up the first couple stairs before stopping to smile at him. He checked his wallet. He knew where things were headed. Just as they were about to get to the top of the massive staircase that split the foyer, they heard blood-curdling screams from the party room. They glanced at each other before rushing down. Graham rushed over to James, who was in a panic. “James, what’s wrong?” “I-I... I don’t know! Everyone’s collapsing!” Graham and Sadie looked around, with Jordan being the only one conscious. Graham shoved James, brushing the wall. “Dude, what the hell did you put in the alcohol?” “W-nothing! I swear!” “Well, then what did ‘your guy’ put in the alcohol?” “He’s never spiked it before, I don’t know why he would.” “Well weren’t you two arguing when he gave you the bag?” “Yeah, he was drunk. Said something about this being his property and that I should leave or there’d be ‘hell to pay’ or ‘dire consequences’ or something Didn’t really care about what he had to say.” “Well, we’re in this. Deep. We’ve gotta wake these people up.” Just then, Katie stirred. Sadie rushed over, kneeling beside her friend. She shook her rapidly. “Katie? Katie! Wake up!” Katie raised her head. “Katie, how are you fe-” Sadie was quickly met with the back of Katie’s hand. Sadie was taken back aghast. “Katie!” Jordan rushed over as Katie rushed towards Sadie. Jordan held back Katie’s arms. “Katie, what the hell was that?” The confusion on their faces quickly turned to dismay. Katie’s eyes were bloodshot, and veins pulsed out of her head. She was decaying, and she had turned bone thin, but even still football linebacker James struggled to keep her lassoed. “What the hell is wrong with her?” yelled Jordan, finally taking one headphone out. Graham ran to the mantle, grabbing the hunting gun and box of shells. “Oh I am not doing this.” exclaimed James, holding Katie by the wrist and whipping her around, sending her tumbling to the floor. “Get to the game room. Now!” Graham, Sadie, James, and Jordan all ran up the stairs, Jordan catching a glimpse of all of the students shaking as Katie did. They sprinted down the hallway, entering the game room at the end of the hallway, James dead bolting the door behind them. “What happened to her?” asked James. “How was she so strong?” “Guys,” interjected Jordan, “I think something real is happening here. I think they may be… zombies.” Jordan let out a chuckle and was given three stern glares. “Graham, you took the gun?” asked Sadie. “Yep. I’ve seen enough movies to know that if I didn’t get it now, getting it later would be harder than I care for. Graham loaded the shotgun with shells from the box, sliding in each shell one at a time and pumping the shotgun. He stuffed the rest of the shells in his varsity jacket pocket and settled in the leather chair, leaning the gun against the chair. “You guys can’t believe that this is more than drunk people, right?” asked Jordan. James turned to the freshman, now stretched out on the somewhat dusty couch. “Look, we have a shotgun and a dead-bolted door. I think we’re good.” Jordan strolled to the game room door, undid the heavy deadbolt, and opened the door slowly. He started out at the empty hallway, staring for a couple seconds. He motioned his arm out, cocksure. As he put out his arm, a hooded figure reached out, grabbing and sinking his teeth into the arm. Jordan fell back into the room, James dead bolting it behind him. Graham leaped from the seat, punting the creature in the stomach, and launching the creature across the room. He was pale under his white hoodie, with similar exaggerated veins, tight skin, and red eyes he saw on Katie. He grabbed the shotgun, threatening the being who was recovering from the kick to the stomach. “Hey, stand up and… uh… put your hands in the air!” The creature wiped the blood from his mouth and lunged forwards, being blasted by the shotgun into pieces. Sadie and James let out equally high-pitched screams as the green blood splashed back on them. They shook and wiped the blood off themselves. “Ok,” Jordan conceded, “It’s zombies.” “We need to get out of here!” said Sadie. “We should call the police first.” explained Jordan. He raced to his phone and sighed. “I’ve been listening to music all night, it’s dead. Well anyone got a working phone?” James and Graham shrugged, and Sadie felt her pockets but got nothing. “Mine’s on the mantle.” she explained. They looked with a mutual grimace, all realizing their need to exit through the door. Graham hesitantly pumped the shotgun, letting out a smoking shell, and undoing the deadbolt. He stared at James, who took hold of the door handle. Graham aimed, and James opened the door. The hallway was still. Graham stepped out slowly and quickly checked his surroundings. Nothing. They stacked up on Graham, James following close behind, Sadie behind him, and Jordan behind her. They crept down, avoiding all of the squeaky planks they saw. As they approached the stairs, one of the infected was slumped over atop a stair. As Graham crossed, the creature grabbed his leg, and Graham blew off its head with the shotgun. “What could’ve been in that beer?” Jordan wondered, “What is this strong?” They descended further, seeing hope in reach. The door was across the room, taunting them. Graham sternly loaded the shotgun with two more shells from his pocket, being the center of attention after the loud shotgun blast. Two creatures ran at him, and he put rounds in each of them. Where once he flinched at the blood, it now ran down his face in proud streams, like tears at the Grand Canyon. They walked confidently to the door, opening it as if he had all of the time in the world. They proceeded down the hill, noticing that the majority of infected were at the fence, struggling to get to the town. As they walked forwards, the others cowering behind Graham’s thousand-yard stare, the infected turned to look. Graham cocked the shotgun, and they dispersed. Graham quickly spotted the hole they had cut into the chain link fence to get to the afterparty. They descended the hill, entering the town.
It was dawn. The house sat taught on the hill. “You ever saw somethin’ like this?” I asked Officer Patrick. “Nah,” he said, “Nah I ain’t.” “And they came to the police?” “Ye’.” “How many again?” “Four, but they found blood ah’ five.” “Think it was planned?” “Nah, no group like this gon’ use an excuse as dumb as zombies.” “So one dead in the game room, one on the stairs, and two in the living room?” “Yessir.” “An’ how the people at the party said it was again?” “‘Said sum’ the kids drank the beer they got from a college friend n’ them four of them started acting funny. ‘Said when they heard the shot upstairs they all ran out ‘cept the DJ and this girl Katie Grace. DJ hadn’t got his equipment yet ‘n Katie was waiting for Mackie.” “Sadie Mackley? One of the killers?” “Yessir.” “An’ the kids that left said they were scrambled at the gate. One had got his jacket caught n’ couldn’t get through the hole. The fence was too tall and dangerous to climb. They ran when those four came out, ‘afraid they were gonna’ get shot. But the group just left.” The case at Mackay Manor would go unsolved. Four dead, a less-than-simple motive, and four teenagers covered in human blood that turned themselves in. They had thought the drinks were poisoned somehow, but when James was questioned, his ‘college friend’ had never existed. They were tried as adults and convicted of murder and accessory to murder respectively. But they denied and denied and denied. They had sworn that blood was green, but the stains on the stairway said otherwise. Many suspect the foulest thing that night was murder, a despicable act between four classmates with varying levels of psychopathic tendencies. But truly, the scariest occurrence of that night was the realization in James’ cell that he had lost, and that for trespassing on the Mackay Manor, the man at the door was right; there were consequences. Or, perhaps even scarier, that the man hadn't told him that. Perhaps, rather than “dire consequences”, it was “die.. or consequences.”
