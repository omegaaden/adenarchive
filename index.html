      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The year is 1889 and the wild west as it is known in the dime novels and new-fangled moving pictures is dying. Gone are the days of stagecoaches venturing west to claim land they feel destined to inhabit. Now, the land good for settling is all settled. Mechanical inventions such as the locomotive and moving picture seek to pervert the rough and tumble life many have become accustomed to out west, bringing a wicked, possibly lethal dose of safety and prosperity. The cowboy is a dying breed clinging to life in the wake of such progress, but this does little to temper the flames they hide within their hearts. 
        <br><br>
        However, within recent times, a new adversary has made itself known. Much prejudice is now shown upon the west of Texas, particularly the cities and counties surrounding Odessa. The famous Odessa crater, once a mere tourist attraction, is said to be having a strange effect on the townsfolk. Doors lock tight. Windows are shuttered. Some do not even acknowledge them, and yet they prowl regardless, these wicked beasts of the night.</p>

      <h2>Odessa</h2>
      <p>Odessa is an impermanent place. As a watering hole on the trailhead, the average passerby within the fifty square miles or so will tell you they’re just passing through. Friends are made, lost, and forgotten here. However, these truths are ingrained within the Odessa citizens who learn young to blow with the wind. Odessa is a melting pot, a microcosm of the American experiment with permanent residents and travelers alike from all corners of the globe due to the innovation of the railroad. Odessa was one of the first cities in Texas to gain and embrace a railroad, one which connected to a blossoming international rail network.
      <br><br>
      There are plenty of things to do for travelers in Odessa. The various saloons throughout town offer plenty of stories and good drinks. The shops are stocked with odds and ends from all over the world with exotic delights available to any with dollars… or bullets. It is routine for the wealthy from Baltimore and New York to enlist cowboys to take them on tours of the landscape. The lucky would be taken a day's travel south to the breathtaking views of Mount Livermore. The less lucky would return largely unharmed, though a great few dollars poorer, not by choice. There is the replica of Stonehenge, assembled and disassembled seemingly at random. And, of course, there is the great crater. 
      <br><br>
      It's rumored that a man from the census wants it to be one of the new seven wonders. But permanent residents think it is anything but wonderful. The crater glows at night. Even the snobs in Dallas know that. But it also whispers. Too often, sleep will be interrupted by the cool breeze of the desert night. The sleeping will awake to find themselves lit only by the moon, their unconscious bodies beckoned to the crater’s edge. And it will begin to whisper terrible truths.
